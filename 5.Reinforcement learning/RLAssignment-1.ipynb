You are to first familiarize with the framework using its [documentation](http://gym.openai.com/docs/), and then implement the Q-learning algorithm for the Chain enviroment (called 'NChain-v0') using default parameters. Finally print the $Q^*$ table at convergence. Take $\\gamma=0.95$. You can refer to the Q-learning Jupyter notebook shown in class, uploaded on Canvas."

    "The k-armed bandit problem, also known as the multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem, deals with scenarios where actions have to take place in an environment without knowledge about the specifics behind the risks and predicted rewards. In other words, it can be applied to aspects where there is a dilemma between exploration vs exploitation - is it worth taking the risk or will the action of not exploring it be of greater loss? We thus have three main components of the CMAP problem - the current and only state, possible actions at that state and the corresponding reward of that action. What stands out with this MDP is the fact that it only involves one state. It can in other words be defined as a stateless MDP. As a result of not having any states, the rewards are only dependent on action taken, meaning that we are not taking into consideration the previous action taken and hence, the reward of one action does not affect the reward of a future action as the reward distributions are fixed for each bandit. That is why the k-armed bandit problem is considered a special case of reinforcement learning (RL) problem, as opposed to the general problem formulations of RL problems where finite MDPs are dealt with."
