We can for example see that Saudi Arabia has one of the higher GDP per capita at approximately \\\\$50,000 and a life expectancy of 75 years. On the same y-coordinate, we find Honduras which is one of Latin America's poorest countries with a GDP of  \\\\$5,000. Even though it seems to be a positive trend related to GDP per capita and life expectancy, deviations from the regression can reveal otherwise. Generally speaking, countries with higher GDP per capita might have the ability to provide better health care to their population as well as better living standards for the people, thus resulting in a higher life expectancy. One must however consider that other factors are at play when looking at life expectancy, not only GDP per capita.  "
