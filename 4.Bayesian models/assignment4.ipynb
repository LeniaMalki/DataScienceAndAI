You can use CountVectorizer to transform the email texts into vectors. Please note that there are different types of Naïve Bayes Classifier in SKlearn (Document is available here). Test two of these classifiers: 1. Multinomial Naive Bayes and 2. Bernoulli Naive Bayes that are well suited for this problem. For the case of Bernoulli Naive Bayes you should use the parameter binarize to make the features binary. Discuss the differences between these two classifiers. "
